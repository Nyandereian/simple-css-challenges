# Simple CSS challenges

The idea of this project is to have a catalogue of simple CSS challenges that
help people learn the basics of CSS.

The project is divided in several challenges with the requirements and a
starting HTML page and a proposed solution. Each challenge has several possible
solutions and we give just one of them.

## Challenges

1. [Smiley faces](./challenges/1/README.md)
2. [Pac-Man ghost](./challenges/2/README.md)
