# Smiley faces

Build a smiley face using just HTML and CSS.

The idea is to build a smiley face like the picture below using CSS and without
modifying the HTML!

Don't worry about trying to make it work on every single browser that exists out
there, the idea is to learn the basics.

## How to start

Please, copy the file [start.html](./start.html) which has the basic HTML
structure of the page and start coding your CSS in the `<style>` tag of the page.

You can take a look at an example solution [here](./example.html).
